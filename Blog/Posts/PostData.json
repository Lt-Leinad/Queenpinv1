                    "Make the most of the Pinterest algorithm by knowing your audience! Who is your target market, and what does your potential audience want? How can you provide value to them, and how will you show it in your pins?",
                    "2. Perfect Your Profile",
                    "Your Pinterest profile name should tell pinners who you are (business or your name) and your role. Make sure your bio is straight to the point on who you are and the value you provide for your audience or customers, and include the most relevant keywords for your niche. Also, be sure to include a professional photo or logo in your profile!",
                    "3. Super SEO",
                    "Pinterest is NOT a social media platform; it’s a visual search engine! Just like with Google, keywords are super important. For the algorithm to boost your content and to increase your brand’s presence, you should include SEO keywords throughout your profile and content.",
                    "4. Pretty Pins",
                    "Like I said before, Pinterest is a visual search engine, so the visuals of your pins are super important! Unattractive, blurry, or poorly sized pins are unlikely to attract users to interact with your pins. So, make sure that pins are in high resolution and in the optimal size (Pinterest recommends 2:3 for standard pins and 1:2.1 for long pins). Also, be sure to use attractive and eye-catching colors, photos, and composition.",
                    "5. Plan Your Pinning Strategy",
                    "Your pinning strategy is critical to boosting your Pinterest presence. Pinterest recommends posting 10-25 pins a day, so planning your content and strategy is key!",
